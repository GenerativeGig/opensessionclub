## Purpose

Create a space for learning about anything with others. (It is fine if no one makes it. You still have to space to learn in your own way.)

I have a burning need to learn and it is a lot more fun with others and with interesting topics.

You can find any information on the internet but the real resource for learning is people.
Only we humans learn so we know how to help our fellow humans do the same.

There is something powerful about setting a date and time for having a serious session. You really should take learning at least as serious as work meetings.

### Questions

- How to make the sessions live after they are done?
  Maybe not, because it is meant to be something that is done actively in the moment.
  An idea would be to allow the participants to leave a note on the session with the option of setting it to public

## How it works

0. Create an account / Login with (google, Facebook etc.)
1. Write down the topic title (ANY TOPIC! No matter how small or large)
2. Write a short description (with a link to connect before we have a chat)
3. Pick a date and time (e.g. 12:00 - 12:47)
4. Pick a language (default: English) (include sign language)
5. Pick communication mode: text, text-to-speech, voice, video, whispering, gestures, sign language, music, morse code etc. (choose one or multiple)
6. Pick the format: presentation, dialog, discussion, debate, interview etc. (choose one or multiple)
7. Pick the max number of participants (1 - endless)

- Focused learning time
- No usernames or ways of contacting the person have to be displayed to the whole world to see. Only the people in the session are able to access the chat

## Bonus features

- Chat opens on website 15 minutes before the session starts so that everyone has time to get on the required ways of communication etc.
  - integrate or create from scratch?
- Button to add date to calendar automatically (or semi automatically)
- Add note to session (public or private)
- All communication happens on the website (audio and video as well)
